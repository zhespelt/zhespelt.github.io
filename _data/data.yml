    assignments:
      - title: "Term-o-Meter"
        link: "#project_tom"
        tagline: |
          Given SeedLegals' mission to be a startup's best friend–and the many thousands of successful funding rounds closed on the platform–Tom was an inevitability.

          Originally envisioned by CEO, Anthony Rose, I developed the initial MVP and v1 of ToM before tasking my team to bring it life. A (currently) internal tool, Tom consists of a visual interface on top of a program that aggregates and analyzes interactions between key deal terms and funding round statistics. 

          Term-o-Meter provides SeedLegals a deep insight into how founders and investors negotiate deal terms and how successful those deals turn out to be.

          Planned updates aim to increase the power of Tom by tracking startup success farther into the future as well as increasing the number of dimensions Tom considers in its analyses.

      - title: "Bad Actor Detection and Swift Suspension"
        link: "#project_badass"
        tagline: |
          To combat phishing, SEO manipulation, and general bot account creation, I created a couple tools using machine learning with Python and SQL to determine the likelihood that a new account was a "bad actor".

          The first tool classified new accounts based on all of the statistically significant data points available, returning the probability of the account being suspended for bad actions in the future. The second scanned and reported on user interactions for patterns indicative of phishing.

          Between the two of these, Rover was able to materially reduce the number of interactions these accounts initiated with users.

      - title: "Graphicacy Module for Data Analytics Training"
        link: "#project_graphicacy"
        tagline: |
          While we've witnessed a massive explosion in data over the past years, we haven't seen a similar rise in data literacy. So, while teaching SQL and data analytics courses at Rover, in order to help democratize access to and understanding of data, I developed a module on data visualization, interpretation, and accessibility.

          This module was quickly made part of the curriculum for all SQL courses at Rover in the US, before being rolled out to all offices shortly after.

      - title: "Diversity Reporting Program"
        link: "#project_dirp"
        tagline: |
          The Program was designed to transparently collect, analyze and present business and workforce data associated with gender and race equality from all of SoundTransit's contractors. It was used to track and prove legal compliance with government contracts for S&D businesses (small and disadvantaged - e.g. female/minority owned).

          My project helped Sound Transit win the Rosa Parks awards, both regionally and nationally, as well as protecting contract bids for S&D businesses.
