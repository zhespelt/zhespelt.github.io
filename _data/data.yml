    assignments:
      - title: "Term-o-Meter"
        link:
        tagline: |
          Originally envisioned by CEO, Anthony Rose, I developed the initial MVP and v1 of the Term-o-Meter, aka Tom, 
          before tasking my team to bring it life. Tom consists of a data visualization layer on top of a program that 
          aggregates and analyzes interactions between key deal terms and funding round statistics.

          Tom provides SeedLegals a deep insight into how founders and investors negotiate deal terms and how 
          successful those deals turn out to be.

      - title: "Bad Actor Detection and Swift Suspension"
        link:
        tagline: |
          To combat phishing, SEO manipulation, and general bot account creation, 
          I created a couple tools using machine learning and natural language processing with Python/NLTK and SQL 
          to determine the likelihood that a new account was a "bad actor".

          The first tool classified new accounts based on all of the statistically significant data points available, 
          returning the probability of the account being suspended for bad actions in the future.
          The second scanned and reported on user interactions for patterns indicative of phishing.

          Between these two tools, Rover was able to materially reduce the number of interactions these accounts 
          initiated with users.

      - title: "Graphicacy Module for Data Analytics Training"
        link:
        tagline: |
          While the amount of data we generate and can access is growing exponentially, our data literacy and numeracy are not.
          So, while teaching the SQL and data analytics courses at Rover, in order to help democratize access to and 
          understanding of data, I developed a module on data visualization, interpretation, and accessibility.

          This module was quickly made part of the curriculum for all SQL courses at Rover in the US, 
          before being rolled out to all offices shortly after.

      - title: "Magic: Duels"
        link:
        tagline: |
          Magic: Duels—an expansive online TCG made by Wizards of the Coast—was quickly approaching launch when WotC 
          made the decision to bring development and tracking for the game in-house.
          
          I gathered a small team to tackle the task of building a solution to capture app data, report on critical 
          performance metrics and monitor player behavior.
          
          Within a few weeks, our project was successfully detecting and stopping fraudulent in-game transactions, 
          delivering full-coverage KPIs to leadership, and exposing pain-points that were causing player drop-off.

      - title: "Diversity Reporting Program"
        link:
        tagline: |
          The Program was designed to transparently collect, analyze and present business and workforce data 
          associated with gender and race equality from all of SoundTransit's contractors. It was used to track and 
          prove legal compliance with government contracts for S&D businesses 
          (small and disadvantaged - e.g. female/minority owned).
          
          My project helped Sound Transit win the Rosa Parks awards, both regionally and nationally, as well as 
          protecting contract bids for S&D businesses.

          I work with Z at SeedLegals - I'm in Marketing and we rely on data to assess our performance and guide our decisions. 
          
          At SeedLegals, Z created our data and BI strategy, built the data infrastructure, and developed and runs company-wide reporting. Z also led projects to help our customers use data, for example to understand which terms are most common in startup contracts, how to reward advisors, and how to decide when to pay themselves a salary. 
          
          Z built the Data team from one (just him) in 2020 to three, hiring Wafa'a in 2021 and Ben in 2022.
          
          I enjoy every meeting with Z - his knowledge and experience of data and data security is unfathomably deep and he's always happy to explain things I don't understand. He cares about people doing the right thing (ethically and legally) and I love how passionate Z is about helping people understand why (as well as how) they should protect their data and personal details. 
          
          Are you still reading this?? Message Z right now!

          Z was my manager and mentor during my work at Seedlegals. Looking back on the growth in the skills I developed and gained since I started working with him is undoubtedly valuable, and I truly appreciate it.
          
          His strong technical background helped in building a well-established data infrastructure layer, creating useful data searching and manipulating tools that made our interaction with the data and files extremely effective and fast, especially when it came to building reports on top of the cleaned BI data layer and answering many business questions. 
          
          He is the kind of leader who thinks about solving complex problems strategically and can visualize how to solve them within scalable frameworks that perfectly fit within the overall system, solves it effectively, and can be scaled up to handle unexpected and emerging challenges. 
          
          Z has keen insights into how people think, learn, behave, and coming from this deep understanding he always cared to lead by creating a safe atmosphere where people can explore and learn about their potential and limits without the fear of making mistakes. He gives the trust and the sense of autonomy to others to own the process without any micromanagement besides providing an open room to always ask for help and find support.
          
          He had never hesitated to give constructive feedback with realistic and actionable pieces of advice to act on and was always generous in dedicating time to mentor us on using many tools, advanced techniques, tips, tricks, and applying the best practices in the field. On a company level, Z contributed by writing, sharing articles, and giving workshops that raised awareness about data security and privacy and emphasized the importance of considering the ethical and moral aspects when sharing and working with data. 
          
          I believe Z's passion, great spirit, and curiosity will always push him toward more success in the future. It was a pleasure working with Z, and I would gladly work with him again, and I wish him the very best in his life and career.

          Z took a very rudimentary data stack of Stitch + Tableau which I had set up and turned the data pipeline into a data engineer’s dream, and the static visualizations into interactive apps to deliver business value. He single-handedly turned Postgres on S3 (per CTO security requirements) into a live refreshing data warehouse with staging and mart tables. This scalable infrastructure allowed the business analysts and data scientists that he hired to get off the ground quickly and set SeedLegals on the path to data success. It also helped significantly that Z has a great eye for talent, and once he hires great staff, he trains them well too. His hires and I benefited from his great patience and tutelage, spending hours passing on knowledge of Data Engineering and Analysis best practices.
