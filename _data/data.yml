career-profile:
    title: "Full-stack Data Professional"
    summary:  >-
        A Seattle native with over a decade of experience successfully leveraging data analytics and business intelligence into action and revenue. I've done so across a range of companies and industries, in both the US and UK.

        My insights have been directly responsible for millions in revenue and savings per year at companies I've worked with, and my teams' projects have been worth many times that.

      - role: "Head of Data"
        time: "Oct 2020 - Sep 2022 · 2 yrs"
        company: "SeedLegals.com"
        details: |
          With 35+ thousand companies and over £1 billion in funding raised, SeedLegals is the largest platform
          for startup funding and legals in the UK. As such, they have some of the most interesting and valuable
          data in their industry.

          In my time working with SL, I've hired and led a wonderful and productive data team, de-siloed
          our source data from a half-dozen disparate systems, built our data warehouse and most of its
          infrastructure, and designed our short and long-term data strategy.

      - role: "Business Analyst III"
        time: "Apr 2018 - Apr 2020 · 2 yrs 1 mo"
        company: "Rover.com"
        details: |
          Millions of completed bookings, hundreds of thousands of active service providers, and more data than
          you can shake a stick at.
          
          While working with Rover, I supported all of Rover Operations: Customer Experience, Safety & Enforcement, Booking Assurance, and Workforce Management.
          I participated in hiring, training, and mentoring new data and business analysts.
          
          My fraud research resulted in workflow changes that saved hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
          by reducing the labor needed to recover disintermediation losses, lowering phishing and account
          takeover attempts, and increasing platform safety.
          
          I engineered a disaster-relief pipeline that cut hurricane and earthquake response rates from multiple
          days to a few hours.
          
          I also wrote the data-literacy module of Rover's SQL 101 coursebook, and co-taught the 5-week course.

      - role: "Senior Business Intelligence Analyst"
        time: "Sep 2013 - Oct 2017 (4 years 2 months)"
        company: "Wizards of the Coast"
        details: |
          Wizards of the Coast—makers of Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, and a thousand other
          games—is a long-time titan in the card-game industry with decades of data on player and customer
          behavior across video games, esports, retail business, and events.
          
          As lead analyst for WotC’s Organized Play division, I developed player behavior models to help
          business understand the impact of program changes, resulting in increased utilization of product—
          considerably reducing printing and shipping inefficiencies.
          
          My team built the data warehouse used for Magic: Duels, which was the first time WotC was able to
          analyze big data from this product line, contributing it to be the most successful installment in the series.
          
          As a Tableau expert, I headed the Tableau Server company-wide rollout, bringing near-real-time insights to stakeholders.
          
          I designed and built an esports commentary pipeline—cutting the roughly 3-week manual process to under 72 hours and dramatically improving its scope.
          
          I conducted research and built valuable models for legal, which aided in favorable outcomes for Wizards and Hasbro.

      - role: "Data Analyst & Systems Administrator"
        time: "Aug 2009 - Dec 2010 (1 year 5 months)"
        company: "Sound Transit"
        details: |
          To provide mass transit to the Pacific Northwest, Sound Transit relies on a lot of contractors and, 
          through their commitment to supporting small and disadvantaged businesses, are responsible for many 
          millions of dollars going to female and minority-owned companies.
          
          While working there I developed a system to acquire, track, and analyze business and workforce data 
          associated with gender and race equality from 500+ companies, ensuring compliance with local and 
          federal contracts. This enabled Sound Transit to obtain and release over $500 million in government 
          grants and was instrumental in the department earning the Rosa Parks Award for outstanding 
          commitment to equality in 2011.

    assignments:
      - title: Term-o-Meter
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          Given SeedLegals' mission to be a startup's best friend–and the many thousands of successful funding rounds closed on the platform–Tom was an inevitability.

          Originally envisioned by CEO, Anthony Rose, I developed the initial MVP and v1 of Tom before tasking my team to bring it life. A (currently) internal tool, Tom consists of a visual interface on top of a program that aggregates and analyzes interactions between key deal terms and funding round statistics. 

          Term-o-Meter provides SeedLegals a deep insight into how founders and investors negotiate deal terms and how successful those deals turn out to be.

          Planned updates aim to increase the power of Tom by tracking startup success farther into the future as well as increasing the number of dimensions Tom considers in its analyses.

      - title: Bad Actor Detection and Swift Suspension
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          To combat phishing, SEO manipulation, and general bot account creation, I created a couple tools using machine learning with Python and SQL to determine the likelihood that a new account was a "bad actor".

          The first tool classified new accounts based on all of the statistically significant data points available, returning the probability of the account being suspended for bad actions in the future. The second scanned and reported on user interactions for patterns indicative of phishing.

          Between the two of these, Rover was able to materially reduce the number of interactions these accounts initiated with users.

      - title: Graphicacy Module for Data Analytics Training
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          While we've witnessed a massive explosion in data over the past years, we haven't seen a similar rise in data literacy. So, while teaching SQL and data analytics courses at Rover, in order to help democratize access to and understanding of data, I developed a module on data visualization, interpretation, and accessibility.

          This module was quickly made part of the curriculum for all SQL courses at Rover in the US, before being rolled out to all offices shortly after.

      - title: Magic Duels
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          """
          Z was pivotal and excellent in making the Duels BI Reporting effort a success...in the weeks preceding launch, he demonstrated attributes of what I consider real excellence, and without him our ask for heroics to deliver BI for the team would have severely suffered. I can cite the specifics:

          -Critical thinking skills- Z thinks through and visualizes a problem in an end-to-end, optionality-driven way.

          -Communication- Z is a consistently excellent, logical communicator. He is able to raise his response above simply replaying what he did, and synthesize answers and comments at the Goal level, which is a rare trait.

          -Domain knowledge- Z knows his stuff when it comes to analysis and BI, able to context switch rapidly between subject matters, and understand cross-dependencies quickly. He was able to grasp and execute excellently on the priorities of the business, and collaborate well with partners in technology.

          -Cuts through It- Z can, and does, often understand the difference between wasted noise and important information, and takes a leadership-level stance in getting the team to see the point.

          -Machine (process) thinking- Z is self-aware of what part he plays in achieving a goal, and tethers to that even when forces of distraction come into play. He’s able to stick to the process, get the results, and prove value rapidly and repeatedly.

          I wanted to call this out because I think it deserves recognition. It may be redundant from comments others have made, but I’ll view that as reinforcing the points.

          As an ancillary point, Z has been helping on the BIDW project, and in many offline conversations, I’m grateful to have his insights and the traits I listed above working in service of making that effort a success as well.
          """

          This was a review my department head shared with me from one of the PMs on the Duels project.

      - title: Diversity Reporting Program
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          The Program was designed to transparently collect, analyze and present business and workforce data associated with gender and race equality from all of SoundTransit's contractors. It was used to track and prove legal compliance with government contracts for S&D businesses (small and disadvantaged - e.g. female/minority owned).

          My project helped Sound Transit win the Rosa Parks awards, both regionally and nationally, as well as protecting contract bids for S&D businesses.
